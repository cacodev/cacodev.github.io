## Congratulations - You're on a new product team with an old product!

### What do you do?

### UX
Get to know your users. How can you breathe new life into their current boring process? Can things be simpler? Guarantee someone has feedback on how things can be better or problems they often encounter. Take a look at the current process. What is overwhelming? Where are there constraints or slowdowns in the business process?

### Product
Assess the current health of the application you now own. What does it cost to operate? What value does it provide to the organization? What if it didn't exist? Look into your crystal ball, are there any data points that could be collected to help influence future decisions? Do you know what the value stream is for your domain? Do you have any way to measure it? 

### Engineers
Early on, look for ways to cut down technical debt. Can you cut down the support cost? When maintaining a legacy system, often support and tech debt creep up and keep teams from being productive on the new thing. Maybe you can write a support dashboard to help resolve or triage issues faster or put some health monitoring in place. 

Then focus on creating a safe path to production. You want to be able to deploy changes safely. This includes but not limited to automated testing, Continuous integration (build and release), properly version control code (and database changes).

Finally, make sure the app is properly instrumented for you and your team. Design and Product will likely have user journeys they will want to measure.


Having been in the situation, I would advise new teams to embrace the new product methodology and do proper discovery and framing. Don't cut corners on this process or it will haunt the team later.

Additionally, It's likely that some of your team has some experience with the product. Maybe one of the engineers supported the system for years and with that, they probably have scars from previous issues. While previous experience is priceless, it is important to not let old baggage get in the way of new ideas.
