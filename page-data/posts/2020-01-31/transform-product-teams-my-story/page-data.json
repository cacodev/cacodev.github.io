I've heard and experienced many attempts at maximizing developer productivity. Some attempts have small social experiments like open-concept seating and some have been large like hiring consultants to do an agile transformation.</p>\n<p>But nothing stacks up to the \"Product Team\" transformation. This change largely came from a new CTO with a new perspective. Paul Gaffney was not a run of the mill CTO. He had big ideas. Big. Scary. Ideas. These ideas were terrifying because this is our lively hood, not just an idea on how to run a little league baseball team practice a little differently. If this failed then there would be a lot of folks looking for new jobs. It didn't take me long to trust in his visions. I was on board with whatever changes he proposed.</p>\n<p>The biggest change that Paul introduced was changing our project teams to balanced product teams. The keyword there is balanced. What this means is that each product team has a UX designer, a Product Manager and less than a handful of Software Engineers (usually 2-4) and they all report to different leadership structures. Everyone on the team has a voice so they can keep the product from spiraling out of control due to one person's poor project management skills. This structure is similar to the US Federal Gov't's 3 branches with the intent to be balanced. No Egos. No Rockstar Developers. Each of these disciplines has a primary objective:</p>\n<p>UX seeks \"What should we build? What does the user want?\"\nProduct Manager seeks \"What is the value in building it? Should it be built?\"\nEngineering seeks \"Can it be built?\" </p>\n<p>The workstream typically starts with UX, they do the discovery research to find the problems and pain points. Then they partner with the product manager to decide what needs to focus on. Research continues until the team has something to build. The items to build are usually high value but minimal effort. That way, the team doesn't go and spend years building the wrong thing.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, this is out of balance and that is OK as long as the team can balance themselves. For example, engineers may suggest building a robot that replaces humans. Product managers can step in and say \"what data suggests that?\" or UX can say \"that not what our users want\".</p>\n<p>Leading me into the next point: Product teams should be data-driven.</p>\n<p>I've been writing software for almost a decade and a common theme is that important people want something built based on what they think is best. While it's true that some have a natural intuition about these things, most do not and are simply gambling on the companies dime. That's why a product team needs to be data-driven. Look for data points that help drive key performance indicators (KPI's). This might be obvious for most teams because you can relate features to sales but a lot of us are in an enterprise world where the solutions we create might not directly affect the bottom line.</p>\n<p>I've been working on a product team for nearly 2 years now and I can say that this way of working is way better than working on a project minded team. Apps have a lifecycle. Many solutions are developed and then are left in place until its replaced with a completely new solution or left to die.</p>\n<p>Overall, Dick's Sporting Goods is handling the transformation well. Before Paul, I was part of a \"bottom-up\" group that was attempting to push DevOps and Lean methodologies to get a similar movement going. Some were on board but most were not. Once this change hit, suddenly I noticed that books like \"The DevOps handbook\" and \"Lean Enterprise\" were found on people's desks. It's great to see how now we can now deliver features fast, run A/B tests, and use our skills to make great technology solutions.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Transform to a Product Team - My story","cover":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/2020-01-31/transform-product-teams-my-story/","coverImageMaxWidth":800}}}
