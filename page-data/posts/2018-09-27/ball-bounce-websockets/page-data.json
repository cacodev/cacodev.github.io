That same ball also appears on the screen of the other players and its done over web sockets.\nFor the server, I used node with socket.io as the web socket package and the front end is just an HTML canvas with some javascript that draws and manages the balls.\nWhat was awesome is that I was able to create the whole thing in such a short amount of time.\nThe code is available here: <a href=\"https://github.com/cacodev/bounce\">https://github.com/cacodev/bounce</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Bouncy Balls Over Web Sockets","cover":{"childImageSharp":null}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/posts/2018-09-27/ball-bounce-websockets/","coverImageMaxWidth":800}}}
