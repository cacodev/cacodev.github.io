Like most developers, I've been using bootstrap for just about every project in the past 5 years. A challenge my team has taken on recently has been to learn CSS so we are not so reliant on Bootstrap.  We've come across 2 really cool and fun tutorials to learn how to leverage CSS for layouts:

Check em out! They're both really easy to do. I was able to move through both of them in less than an hour.
